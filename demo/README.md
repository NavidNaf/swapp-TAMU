# INTRO

This demo is designed to work in our provided artifact (as docker images) to deploy SWAPP. Please check our Zenodo link to use these demo. The install.sh and deploy.sh scripts are based on Ubuntu. 

If your system does not have docker installed, simply execute install.sh. After it has finished, execute deploy.sh. The deploy.sh script will unzip public_html.zip and change permission of the extracted folder. Then, it will deploy docker instances neccessary to run SWAPP.

Note that the instances run common HTTP and SQL ports. When encounter an error, please stop other Apache2 or SQL running services.

We provide several a demo page for each of the four apps discussed in the paper. When interacting with each demo, please make sure the previous demo's service worker are removed. This is to prevent other service workers from crashing the current demo.
